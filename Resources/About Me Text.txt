Hello! I'm Phillip Swann, a passionate developer and tech enthusiast. I'm currently studying the T-Level in Digital Production, Design and Development, where I’m learning how to turn creative ideas into real, working projects.

This website, along with all of my subprojects, serves as a space to experiment, learn, and grow as a developer. I enjoy exploring new technologies, improving my design skills, and understanding how different tools fit together to create great digital experiences.

I’m always looking for new ways to challenge myself — whether that’s learning new web development techniques, experimenting with frameworks, or building small side projects for fun. In the near future, I plan to dive into game development with Unity and app development with Kotlin and Flutter to expand my skills even further.

Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you’d like to collaborate, share ideas, or just talk tech!
